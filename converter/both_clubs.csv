From LA to NYC and now Scottsdale, Popular Gay Club Night Arrives to 6 Lounge

The major success of club-night concept Beige Tuesdays that gained its popularity in Hollywood, California at club Falcon and Bowery Bar in New York City, has finally come to Scottsdale, AZ.

Conceived in 2004, Beige Tuesdays became an overnight sensation when it opened its doors to overwhelming response as the only gay night at Falcon nightclub located on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. 

This popularity led to the subsequent launch of Beige's east coast counterpart at Bowery Bar in New York City in 2005. Located In the heart of the East Village, Beige eventually developed a reputation as the premier Tuesday night gay event in the city and remains so even until this day. 

6 Lounge offers an upscale evening of food tasting, martini sipping, mingling and dancing to the sounds of retro pop, house and electro courtesy of DJ's Jonny Noir, Tsunami, Sister Sin, DJ DS and Marc Echeveste. 

Key players include lead promoters Ben Brosseau, Nelson Hawks, Travis Berg, Marcus Hunt as well as an all-star roster of models, hosts, 'startenders', and drag queens each week. 

Beige Tuesday runs every week beginning August 5th from 9pm until 2am. Proper dress is required. There is no cover charge."|"Dancing,DJ,Full Bar,Live Entertainment,Drag Shows,Wheel Chair Access,Outdoor/Patio,Credit Cards Accepted,ATM on premises,Free Parking"|""

From the moment you walk into the Bossanova, you can feel the refined ambiance of a classic,  turn-of-the-century social club infused with the energy of a hip, urban lounge. Our vision incorporates the elegant, art-deco stylings of an original, old-world Freemason's Hall into a 21st century nightclub with a state-of-the-art Rat Trap 5 sound system, and a lighting assembly that is adept at creating the right mood for your style. There is plenty of space to mix it up in an atmosphere that is  festive and relaxing at the same time.  The main dance floor is crafted from beautiful Brazilian Cherry, and features a red, velvet-curtained stage that is dynamic and flexible, so it can accommodate live talent from solo-performers to Big Bands. The monitor board can be located on stage or off- whichever you prefer. The double-height ballroom boasts 25 foot ceilings, with a view from the Mezzanine level above, which features an antique Billiards Room with 6 full-size tables and a separate private lounge; either or both of these sections would be perfect for VIP entertaining if you are so inclined. The Main Lounge, located to the left of the Ballroom, features cut-out window seating, so you?d be hard-pressed to find a bad seat in the house. This venue has the ability to be sectioned into various compartments and is perfect for hosting all-ages shows with 21/over restricted areas. It seamlessly combines the original 1909 charm with all the amenities of a brand new space. The electrical and plumbing systems were completely updated in the Summer of 2004, and the entire building was re-designed to meet 2004 Fire Code and Life Safety specifications.  The Bossanova is very centrally located;  just a short shot across the Burnside Bridge and you're in the heart of Old Town, Downtown Portland's hot-spot for the nightlife scene."|"Dancing,DJ,Full Bar,Pop Music,Live Entertainment,Food Served,Non-Smoking Indoors,Smoking Throughout,Credit Cards Accepted,ATM on premises,Pool Tables,Cover Charge"|""

As a true 'come as you are' joint you can dress as casual, swanky or slutty as you dare. The music mix starts out Pop/Top 40 and progresses to Hi-NRG dance as the crowd gets heavier. The dance floor begins to fill completely around midnight.

The Eagle also offers the usual gay staples---drag queens and leather boys, but we also have porn stars! Some of the adult industry's finest drop by to do guest spots in addition to more conventional music acts.

The weekend cover (FREE admission with a valid OSU Buck•ID) gets you in and gives you access to bartenders who want to help you really, really forget your troubles with the lowest drink prices in town.

The Eagle is a consistent, dynamic and fun place to go.

It debuted in 1993, and has become a wildly popular institution. The club has never advertised, and the 700-1000 people each month come by word of mouth.

Dragstrip happens on the 2nd Saturday of each month, with a different theme. The concept is to dress up in any kind of drag -for the theme, or any masquerade at all. But everyone is welcome in any dress. The crowd is about 80% gay men, 10% lesbians, and 10% straight folks - the cool straight folks, by the way. The age group is late 20's to late 40's. One thing people always comment on, is how super friendly the people and vibe is at Dragstrip. It's really a blast!

Dragstrip's music is basically a fun mix of EVERYTHING from the 1960's to 2002 - alternative rock, pop, soul, techno, funk, hip-hop. In one hour you could hear Nirvana then Abba then Mary J. Blige then Duran Duran etc. - it's totally diverse and you never know what's coming next - which is part of the fun.

Dragstrip features a live drag show after midnite - but NO LIP SYNCHING - and no Judy/Whitney/Liza types etc. Usually the queens sing songs with lyrical parodies tied to the theme.

If your plans take you to Los Angeles on the 2nd weekend of the month, Dragstrip is a must-see, must-experience kind of place. Come join us!"|"Dancing,DJ,Full Bar,Techno Music,Live Entertainment,Drag Shows,Videos,Wheel Chair Access,Non-Smoking Indoors,Outdoor/Patio,Valet Parking,Cover Charge"|""

Ghost School is ready to haunt the gloomy London night. We need to dance to decent tunes and we play decent tunes for people of all persuasions to dance to. We mix the shock of the new with cult classics and guilt-free pleasures. We like our synths with sincerity and our pop with snap and crackle. We love arty rockers with electric guitars, twee freaks with knitted agendas, gay geeks with scuffed shoes, and party poppers who love their liquor. So dust off your dancing shoes and show us what you're made of.

Maybe you'd like to know a little more?

Well it's only fitting that we firstly introduce ourselves as Camilla, Alex and John. We do bits of this and that, mainly involving writing, art, television, radio, blogs, record-collecting and obsessive gig-going but most importantly we are a friendly bunch who are keen on making music-lovers dance. We started Ghost School with this express intention and to also create a unique space where everyone can contribute and feel comfortable.

The club is queer-run but all are welcome in the hope of attracting a diverse bunch onto a dancefloor free from intimidation or tired stereotypes. Finally, it is important to us that you feel as much a part of Ghost School as we do, so send us your thoughts, comments, requests and creations. See you down the disco.

JR's attracts a sizable portion of the city's professional crowd – most of the men look like they should be posing for a fashion ad  It's a bustling place with the kind of good-time camaraderie one might find in a fraternity house  Owned by a Dallas-based corporation, JR's is comfortable and clean, with pristine brass railings along the room-length bar and large stained-glass windows  The high-ceilinged room sports a giant video screen, and there's an upper berth – a loft – that houses a pool table and serves as a getaway from the throngs  

The bartenders are affable to regulars and newcomers alike – there's little attitude here  And manager Eric Little is always dreaming up new ways for his customers to have rip-roaring fun, such as the annual Easter Bonnet competition   There's always a reason to visit JR's  – Randy Shulman

The beautiful people frequenting the bars of Jl Dyana Pura are in for a real treat every evening EVERY day thanks to a simply stunning ambient LED lighting design concept first seen in Europe and Australia and now proudly brought to Bali as a “First for Asia” by the talented designers of this super cool super smart bar.

A hugely technical computer controlled environ-ment mixer changes the internal bar colour and also the total environment. When Kudos want to create a cool, ice blue tint, a warm Bali sunset glow, a beautifully fresh air green naturalness or an azure ocean deep tranquillity they can do it – at a touch of a button.

Theme evenings and special party nights are sure to be stunning events at the bar sure to be the star of Jl. Dyana Pura. Indoor and outdoor areas provide comfortable “lagoons” where you and your friends can drink incredibly good value drinks served by chic and attentive boys and girls –and for those who want to indulge themselves there's soon to be a VIP upper deck with specially mixed cocktails and champagne flowing.
This is definitely a bar that's going to set the pace for others to follow –but its going to be hard for any bar to match up to this!. The attention to detail is mind-blowing. The bathrooms designs are the result of a special commission given to one of Chinas most talented design houses and cost a small fortune but its attention to things like that that will surely attract the well heeled visitor to bali.

Kudos is aimed at for boys who like girls, boys who like boys and girls who like girls –all with an appetite for partying – 6 Hi-Definition Video Screens, 15000 watt sound system (sound you can FEEL) and the talents of top New York DJ Jay Sample will fill the dramatic inside and smart outdoor terrace (also with individual “lagoons” with sumptuous seating).

Although we cater to the gay community, Twist has become a melting pot of gay/bi and straight people from all over. Billing ourselves as “Alternative Lifestyle” we allowed a place where you can be yourself, or be someone else! At times you may have no idea who may be standing next to you. We have had the pleasure of both local and national celebrities visit Twist and having, quote: “The Greatest Time.”

We credit our success with a number of things, a few being: a state of the art digital sound system that is second to none and that will rival ANY. And the lighting is a perfect compliment to the music. Speaking of music, you will never hear any Top 40, Hip-Hop, or rap…just Heavy House/Club Tracks spun buy the most talented DJ's who will never, like some clubs, “talk over” the music. This we like to consider the “Heartbeat” of Twist.

In addition to the “Club” at Twist, we also have a quieter area called the “Main Bar.” For those of you that don't care for the loud, pounding music or you're just not in the mood that particular night and want a more social atmosphere, this is the place. We offer 8 draft selections as well as a bar menu daily and complete dinners on Sundays. Weather permitting; the “Patio” is open with access through the Main Bar. The Patio not only offers a full bar but also specializes in varieties of frozen drinks even ones you create yourself. The Main Bar is open every night and there is never a cover."|"Dancing,DJ,Full Bar,Drag Shows,Food Served,Karaoke,Dancers/Strippers,Smoking Throughout,Outdoor/Patio,Credit Cards Accepted,ATM on premises,Free Parking,Video Games"|""
